        <h1 data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Origin Story</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-500 font-primary md:pr-6 lg:pr-0">
          Paulette became a young widow at the age of 30. Her two children were just 4 and 6 years old at the time. 
          Despite having limited resources, she managed to provide her kids with a good life. 
          Just when things were getting better, Paulette encountered an even greater challengeâ€”cancer. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For about a decade and a half, her life revolved around trips to the doctor, regular checkups, and staying healthy. 
          Years of medical files were taking up space in their home and complicating her daily life. 
          As she shuttled between Guam (where she is based) and the Philippines, carrying her medical files to 
          different doctors and pharmacies became too cumbersome and costly. 
          Replenishing her medication had become a guessing game. Staying healthy sometimes became detrimental to her own health. 
          Paulette stood strong as a cancer warrior and survivor.
          <br>
          <br>
          Dale, our founder, is the son of Paulette.
        </p>
        <h1 data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Our Mission</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-500 font-primary md:pr-6 lg:pr-0">
          Paulette's struggle is not unique. Millions, if not billions, have similar experiences with their medical records. 
          Thus, it is EasyJoey's mission to make healthcare data easily accessible to anyone, anywhere, securely, and privately. 
          We believe that a person's medical history is crucial for a comprehensive diagnosis, treatment, and care. 
          If there is a lack of data or if it is fragmented, it leaves a gap for misdiagnosis and potential lack of proper treatment. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To achieve this, EasyJoey is first focused on resolving the <em><strong>'Holy Grail of Health Data'</strong></em> :  <u><em>how to make medical records shareable 
          without compromising security, privacy, and ownership</em></u>. EasyJoey is building a platform to make this happen. 
          This is a technology that clinicians can use to help more patients and save more lives.
        </p>
        <h1 data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Our Values</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-500 font-primary md:pr-6 lg:pr-0">
          EasyJoey is more than just a health technology company. At our core, <em><strong>we believe that ordinary people who care the extra mile 
          are the heroes who make this world a better place </strong></em>. These heroes include physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, 
          healthcare workers, and even mothers and guardians who work day and night to make things work and help heal the world. 
          They are the ones who save lives. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This is what we believe, and the reason for our existence 
          is to continue building products that will help these heroes do their jobs better, 
          so they can focus more on what they do best: healing the world.
        </p>
        <h1 data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Our HealthTech Excerience</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" class="mb-10 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-500 font-primary md:pr-6 lg:pr-0">
          In 2016, Dale and his college buddy Joel started <a href="https://www.mycure.md" style="color:#4B7A3C;" target="_blank">MYCURE</a>, 
          a clinic management system, along with a core team of passionate individuals. 
          However, the path was far from easy, and we had to pivot and iterate many times over the next 4+ years. 
          During this journey, we came to realize the crucial importance of having a health tech infrastructure as 
          the foundation for the various solutions we were developing. 
          As a result, we also created HAPI Hub, a set of powerful healthcare APIs that you can explore at 
          <a href="https://docs.hapihub.com" style="color:#4B7A3C;" target="_blank">docs.hapihub.com</a>.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout our journey, we gained valuable insights and identified numerous pain points in the electronic medical 
          records (EMR) space, including issues related to security, ownership, accessibility, privacy, speed, and ease of use. 
          While many providers have attempted to address some of these issues, none have tackled them comprehensively. 
          <br>
          <br>
          After years of close collaboration with our clients, gaining an in-depth understanding of their challenges, and conducting 
          extensive research on available technologies, we stumbled upon a crucial insight. This insight led to the development of 
          a "medical record-focused," 'local-first' software, and a "collaborative" app, both aimed at finally addressing the 
          Holy Grail of healthcare data.
          <br>
          <br>
          And thus, EasyJoey was born.
